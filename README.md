## Contributing

Have an idea for improving this widget? [Open an issue](https://github.com/cobyism/ubersicht-github/issues/new) or fork this repository and send a pull request :grinning:.

Things I’d love to do but haven’t had time for yet:

- [ ] Make it possible to see private contributions, probably by using a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/applications) or something.
- [ ] Add an octocat logo/mark to the header from [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com).
- [ ] Consider adding the legend/axis labels shown on the web version.

If you want to contribute, having a go at one of these items above might be a good place to start! :+1:
